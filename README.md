# 🤖 Automation Scripts

Welcome to my **Automation** folder — a growing collection of Bash, CLI, and DevOps tools that I'm building as I level up my skills in Linux system administration, infrastructure automation, and cloud operations.

These scripts are designed to solve real problems, automate manual tasks, and deepen my understanding of system behavior, DevOps pipelines, and monitoring.

## 📂 Current Projects

### `server-stats.sh`
A Bash script that displays system performance statistics:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk usage
- Top 5 CPU and memory-hungry processes

✅ Ideal for quick server health checks  
📁 Full project: [server-stats repo](https://github.com/LilithDevOps/Automation/tree/main/server-stats)

## 🛠️ Why This Folder Exists

I'm using this folder to:
- Practice automation through real scripts
- Document what I learn in Bash and Linux
- Build a clean, focused DevOps GitHub presence

Each script includes clear comments and may be part of larger projects later (like Terraform deployments, monitoring stacks, or Docker-based tools).

## 🌱 Coming Soon

- Nginx Log Analyzer
- Log Archive Tool
- SSH Remote Server Setup
